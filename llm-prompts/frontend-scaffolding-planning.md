Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building the project defined in @project-spec.md. Then, once you have a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other. Look at these chunks and then go another round to break it into small steps. review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely, but big enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project.

From here you should have the foundation to provide a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step. Prioritize best practices, and incremental progress, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step.

Make sure and separate each implementation llm prompt, saving each in a separate markdown file. The goal is to output prompts, but context, etc is important as well. Number each prompt and give each a title. The filename should have the prompt number and title in it. The title should also be specified in each prompt as the commit title to use once its changes are finished. Each prompt should include steps to verify the changes work correctly, it could be unit test descriptions or manual testing steps.
