You are adding the very first commit of a new Rust backend project called “monolith-backend”.

Tasks:
1. Run `cargo new monolith-backend --lib`.
2. Update `Cargo.toml` package section:
   - edition = "2021"
   - description = "Rust GraphQL monolith for private family use"
3. Set up a fresh Git repo and commit all files with message: "chore: initial cargo skeleton".
Return the diff including `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` (empty for now).
