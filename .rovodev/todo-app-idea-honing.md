Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this project idea.
Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to an agent so it can draft a plan for building the project.
Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail.
Remember, only one question at a time.

Here's the idea:

"A todo mobile app that myself and my family will use.
The app will be deployed using the existing pattern in this repo.
I have listed the features I want the app to have in `todo-app-features.md`."

Once we’ve wrapped up the iterative brainstorming process, compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification.
Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, and error handling strategies so the planning agent has all the information they need to draft the build plan.
