Now we have the project spec, please draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building this project. Then, once you have a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other. Look at these chunks and then go another round to break it into small steps. review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely, but big enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project.

From here you should have the foundation to provide a series of tickets that you can pick up one by one to implement each step. Prioritize best practices, and incremental progress, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each ticket builds on the previous tickets, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step.

Write each ticket to a separate file. Use markdown. Each ticket should be numbered. The goal is to output tickets, but context, etc is important as well.
