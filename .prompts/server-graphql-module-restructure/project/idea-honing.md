Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this project idea.
Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to an agent so it can draft a plan for building the project.
Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail.
Remember, only one question at a time.

Here's the idea:

"sort out the module structure of this server's GraphQL mutations and queries. At the moment it is a mess. I would like each mutation and query to be in a separate file, named after the query or mutation. These files should be nested according to which front end web or mobile app they have been implemented for. Some mutations and queries are shared e.g. those todo with user authentication and refresh logic. These should be nested under a "shared" directory."

Once we’ve wrapped up the iterative brainstorming process, compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification.
Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, and error handling strategies so the planning agent has all the information they need to draft the build plan.
